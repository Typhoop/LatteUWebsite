                <h1>What is LatteU?</h1>
                <p style="font-size: larger; margin-left: 2%;">LatteU is a initiative to revive and restore, many old apps that the Wii U has in store.
                    Some of these apps are still even in the Wii U's source code! (Isn't that neat?) Our current focus
                    right now is a very old app on the Wii U, TVii! 
                    
                    <li style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 2%;">
                        TVii was a TV guide tool that allowed you to search between all of your favorite movies, and tv shows! It was eventually shut down in August of 2015. Although
                        that isn't gonna stop us from reviving it! 
                    </li>

                    <li style="list-style-type: square; padding-top: 15px; margin-left: 2%; padding-bottom: 35px;">Another neat feature of TVii is TvTag! TvTag was a service that interacted with miiverse, in such a way that it allowed you to comment on tv shows,
                        doodle on images of media, and predict what may happen in that particular piece of media!
                    </li>
                </p>

                <h1>Is LatteU Finished?</h1>
                <p style="font-size: larger; margin-left: 2%;">Funny question! It's never gonna be finished.. What we mean is, LatteU is an ever-growing project that is in development always!
                Of course, TVii isn't gonna just be what we are known for. We also have many other apps and fun things in store, after TVii is around 90% done! We cannot share what those are yet, although we can give a hint..</p>
